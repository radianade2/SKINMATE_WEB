Database - Controller - View

### Page 1 (Homepage)
<t/>Homepage is front page of the SKINMATE website. It contains essential information about the website, such as a general information link regarding the user's current location, information about commonly used skincare products, product descriptions at the bottom of the page, and of course, a link to a user feedback form.<br/>
The highlight of this page is the moving images that display global climate conditions every second. This display uses JavaScript to generate it. The product information is then displayed in a carousel format to save space and enhance user interaction. Here's the SKINMATE website's homepage: <br/>

### Page 2 (input filling)

### Page 3 (product recommendation results)
<t/>The third page is the final page of this website. This page displays the results of the user's input, including product recommendations for conditions that match the user's input. Recommended products include moisturizers, serums, and sunscreens, each type of which has been adjusted to the conditions specified by the user. In addition to product recommendations, this page also displays brief weather information for the location the user has entered, such as a description of the current weather, temperature, and wind speed. This form also provides a user forum to provide additional information and tips on weather-appropriate skincare products. <br/>
